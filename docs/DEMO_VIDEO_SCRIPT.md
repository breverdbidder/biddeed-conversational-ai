---

## SCENE 1: HOOK (0:00 - 0:15)

### Visual
Open browser to https://brevard-bidder-landing.pages.dev/agent

### Script
> "What if you could analyze every foreclosure auction in Brevard County in seconds instead of hours? I'm Ariel Shapira, and this is BidDeed.AI - an agentic AI platform that transforms how real estate investors find opportunities."

---

## SCENE 2: THE PROBLEM (0:15 - 0:35)

### Visual
Quick montage (optional):
- Screenshot of court records website
- Spreadsheet with property data
- Clock/timer graphic

### Script
> "Traditional foreclosure research is brutal. You're manually searching court records, calculating max bids, checking liens, researching comparables - 2-3 hours per property, easily. Miss one lien? You could lose your entire investment."

---

## SCENE 3: THE SOLUTION - AGENT UI (0:35 - 1:30)

### Visual
Show /agent interface - type and demo live queries

### Demo Flow
1. Type: **"What auctions are coming up?"**
   - Show response with auction dates

2. Type: **"Show me BID recommendations"**
   - Show property results grid populating
   - Point out BID/REVIEW/SKIP ratings

3. Type: **"Analyze 923 Slocum St Melbourne"**
   - Show detailed analysis appearing
   - Highlight: judgment amount, ARV, max bid calculation, ML score

### Script
> "BidDeed.AI is conversational - just ask what you need. 'What auctions are coming up?' Done. 'Show me BID recommendations' - instantly filtered. Want details on a specific property? Just ask. The AI runs our 12-stage Everest Ascent pipeline - the same methodology that's helped me close dozens of deals over 10 years."

> "See these scores? Our machine learning model predicts third-party bidder probability with 64% accuracy. That intelligence tells you which properties are worth pursuing and which to skip."

---

## SCENE 4: THE MAP (1:30 - 2:00)

### Visual
Navigate to /map - show Leaflet interface

### Demo Flow
1. Zoom to show all Brevard County markers
2. Click filter: **"BID Only"** - show green markers
3. Click on a property marker
4. Show popup with key metrics

### Script
> "Visual learner? Here's every foreclosure plotted on a map. Green markers are BID recommendations, yellow for REVIEW, red for SKIP. Click any property - instant access to judgment, ARV, plaintiff, and our calculated bid-to-judgment ratio. This is the same data, different interface."

---

## SCENE 5: UNDER THE HOOD (2:00 - 2:30)

### Visual
Optional - show activity log in agent UI or quick diagram

### Script
> "Under the hood, BidDeed.AI integrates with BCPAO for property data, AcclaimWeb for lien searches, RealForeclose for auction info, and Census data for demographics. No more tab-switching between 5 different websites."

> "And here's the kicker - it runs on Smart Router V5, defaulting to Gemini's free tier for most queries. That's AI-powered foreclosure research at essentially zero marginal cost."

---

## SCENE 6: THE VALUE (2:30 - 3:15)

### Visual
Show /chat interface briefly, then return to agent

### Script
> "The math is simple. One extra deal per quarter from better research? That's $50,000. One avoided loss from catching a hidden lien? Another $100,000. Time saved? Priceless when you're running multiple businesses like I am."

> "This isn't SaaS - it's an agentic AI ecosystem. The same architecture can plug into auction.com, tax deed sales, or any other real estate vertical. Brevard County is just the start."

---

## SCENE 7: CTA (3:15 - 3:30)

### Visual
Show all three URLs on screen

### Script
> "BidDeed.AI is live right now at brevard-bidder-landing.pages.dev. Agent interface, interactive map, and chat - all free to try. Built by a foreclosure investor, for foreclosure investors."

> "I'm Ariel Shapira, Everest Capital USA. Let's connect."
